This line was made before i commited/added to a repository

Here is my second line. I am going to now commit it, but not push it

Here is my third addition, I plan to use >git: commit amend to upload this change to commit2 and upload to GitHub

Blah Blah 5th commit, im just commiting it and using the message window. Then I'll push
